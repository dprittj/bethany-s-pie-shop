2024.05.01: Scripting currently at a standstill. Having trouble figuring out how to count quantity of repeated orders without over/under counting; add accumulator function to each button? 

Currently, pies are placed by name into an array, with their correlative prices placed into another array. Reading the array out to display on the cart.html page, however appears tricky. Would be okay with listing each instance of a pie, but would prefer the name listed once with a quantity numeral beside it.
